# ðŸŽ‰ NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT ISSUE FIXED!

## âœ… **PROBLEM SOLVED**

The Netlify deployment error was caused by an incorrect publish directory configuration.

### **The Issue:**
```
Error: Publish directory is configured incorrectly. Please set it to "dist/clips/browser".
```

### **The Fix:**
Updated `netlify.toml` to use the correct publish directory:

**Before:**
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist/clips"
```

**After:**
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist/clips/browser"
```
