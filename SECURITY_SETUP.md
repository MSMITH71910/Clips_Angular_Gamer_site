# üîê Security Setup Guide

## Overview
This project has been secured to prevent API keys and sensitive configuration from being exposed in the source code.

## ‚úÖ Security Improvements Made

### 1. Removed Hardcoded API Keys
- **Before**: Firebase API keys were hardcoded in `scripts/generate-env.js`
- **After**: All sensitive data is now loaded from environment variables

### 2. Updated Environment Generation
- The `scripts/generate-env.js` now requires environment variables to be set
- No fallback to hardcoded values
- Validates that all required environment variables are present

### 3. Enhanced .gitignore
- Added `.env*` files to prevent accidental commits of sensitive data
- Environment files (`environment.ts`, `environment.prod.ts`) remain ignored

### 4. Secure Project References
- Removed hardcoded project ID from `enable-auth.js`
- Replaced with placeholder instructions

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Environment File
```bash
# Run the setup script
./setup-secure-env.sh

# Or manually copy the example
cp .env.example .env
```

### Step 2: Configure Your Firebase Credentials
Edit the `.env` file with your actual Firebase configuration:

```env
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

### Step 3: Generate Environment Files
```bash
# This will create environment.ts and environment.prod.ts
node scripts/generate-env.js
```

### Step 4: Build and Run
```bash
# The prebuild script will automatically generate environment files
npm run build

# Or for development
npm start
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- **Never commit `.env` files** to version control
- Use different `.env` files for different environments (development, staging, production)
- Store production secrets in your deployment platform's environment variables

### Firebase Security
- Regularly rotate your API keys
- Use Firebase Security Rules to restrict access
- Monitor Firebase usage for unusual activity

### Deployment
- Set environment variables in your deployment platform:
  - **Netlify**: Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables
  - **Vercel**: Project settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
  - **Firebase Hosting**: Use Firebase Functions config

## üö® Previously Exposed Information

The following information was previously hardcoded and has been secured:

- **Firebase API Key**: `AIza
- **Project ID**: `clips-`
- **App ID**: `1:854666

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Consider regenerating these credentials in your Firebase console for maximum security.

## üìã Checklist

- [ ] Created `.env` file with your Firebase configuration
- [ ] Verified `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Generated environment files successfully
- [ ] Tested application builds without errors
- [ ] Set up environment variables in deployment platform
- [ ] (Optional) Regenerated Firebase credentials for enhanced security

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Missing required environment variables" Error
- Ensure your `.env` file exists and contains all required variables
- Check that variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Verify no extra spaces or quotes around values

### Build Fails
- Run `node scripts/generate-env.js` manually to check for errors
- Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
- Check that Firebase configuration is valid
